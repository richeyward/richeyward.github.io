## Statistical Analysis of Cracked Hashes

Now that we have an ample pool of random brute forced passwords (in future called 'bruted'), The next phase of analysis can begin, which will be a continual loop ad infinitum.  We want to figure out what dictionary wordlists and rules were used to create the bruted words. Once we make a decision, a run of the wordlist and rule (called a solve) will be ran. The solves should find new passwords and ones in the bruted list will be removed. This process will repeat until there is diminishing returns. To recap, the process is as follows:

- Remove solved passwords from bruted pile
- Analyze remaining bruted passwords for patterns
- Create new wordlists and rules from analysis
- Run new solves
- Repeat

### Analytics Automation

I created a script to perform two main actions. Firstly to build a substring table and look for common occurrence and secondly to look for any character patterns.  

#### Substrings

If we have a list of example passwords like so:

```
password123
PassWord456
welcome123
```

Then some common (non case sensitive) repeating substrings would be `password` and `123`.  The more common and longer the word, the more we should focus on how to generate it. This will be the primary driver on what dictionary wordlists to persue and what rules to apply them to. As longer words are more desired the length of the substring will be multiplied to the 


#### Character Patterns

Character patterns may be useful for determining the occurrences of letters

For example, there may be a bunch of passwords with 5 letters and 3 numbers at the end. This would be represented as `XXXXX000` where `'X'` is for letters and `'0'` is for numbers. Special characters are represented with a `'?'`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Analytics"""

import os
from collections import Counter

c = Counter()
c2 = Counter()

words = []

# Add passwords from cracked file
for x in open("kl2010.pot").read().splitlines():
    if x.startswith("$NT$"):
        word = x[37:]
    if word not in words:
        words.append(x[37:])

for b in words:
    for x in range(20, 2, -1):
        if len(b) >= x:
            for i in range(len(b)-x+1):
                c[b[i:x+i].lower()] += 1
    mapping = ""
    for char in b:
        if char.isalpha():
            mapping += "X"
        elif char.isdigit():
            mapping += "0"
        else:
            mapping += "?"
    c2[mapping] += 1


# Multiply the string patterns by length. Longer and more common to the top
for word in c:
    c[word] *= len(word)


print("=== Top unknown strings ===")
for var in c.most_common(20):
    if var[1] > 1:
       print(var)

print("\n=== Top unknown patterns ===")
for var in c2.most_common(20):
    if var[1] > 1:
       print(var)
```

Executing the above shows the following:

```
=== Top unknown strings ===
('2010', 612)
('201', 474)
('010', 468)
('defco', 435)
('defc', 428)
('july', 420)
('def', 405)
('defcon', 396)
('hello', 395)
('efco', 384)
('efcon', 375)
('fcon', 372)
('con', 351)
('efc', 348)
('fco', 348)
('hell', 324)
('jul', 321)
('ello', 316)
('uly', 315)
('vegas', 315)

=== Top unknown patterns ===
('XXXXXXX', 324)
('XXXXXX?', 324)
('XXXXXX0', 226)
('XXXXXX', 141)
('XXXXXXX??', 80)
('XXXXXX???', 66)
('??XXXXXXXX', 63)
('0XXXXXX', 62)
('?XXXXXXX?', 55)
('00XXXX?', 54)
('000000?', 46)
('XXXX?00', 43)
('XXXXX00', 42)
('XXX0000?', 38)
('00XXXXX?', 37)
('??XXXXXX', 36)
('??XXXXXXX', 35)
('XXXXXXXX?0', 31)
('XXXXXX00?', 30)
('X0XXXXX', 29)
```

It is clear that some common words are starting to appear like `2010`, `defcon`, `vegas`, and `hello`.
